# - get basic config
# - find # of genres
# - read in arrays of genres and weights


get default value
    get variations for specific genres

BIG DIFFERENCE HERE STEVEN IS THAT YOU ARE NOT LOADING IN A BIG ARRAY,
YOU ARE LETTING GREP/RG DO THE WORK


# POINT ONE
if counter > limit, ERROR
determine number of genres
randomly select number
get # of genre name (mpc list genre | head | tail)
grep our config for the genre name and matching weight value
    use weight from config
    if not found, use default weight value
grep our logfile for genre name
    if -c > weight, go to POINT ONE, increment a counter
# POINT TWO
if counter2 > limit, then goto POINT ONE
get number of songs in genre
randomly select # from that list
find song length
    if song length > allowed (check for hours!), goto POINT TWO, increment counter2
grep our logfile for song name, band name
    if -c > weight for either song or band, goto POINT TWO, increment counter2
add song to playlist
add info to logfile
    
    
    
    use this to find if it's been played dynamically using just one logfile

        currenttime=$(TZ=UTC0 printf '%(%s)T\n' '-1')
        difftime=$(( "$VALUE" * 60 )) #they're in minutes
        hightime=$(( "$currenttime"-"$difftime" ))
        # feed this into a variable, or grep stdin (not sure you can do that)
        cat "$GenreLogFile" | awk -F '@@@' -v hightime="$hightime" '$1 > hightime'  > "$tempfile"
